                  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                  <dl>
                    <dt>What can I expect in my first appointment?</dt>
                      <dd>I usually ask that you arrive 10 minutes early for your first appointment so that you have time to fill out a brief health history form (unless you've already filled it out and submitted it online!).  Once in the treatment room, I'll go over your health history form with you, ask you some questions and carry out some sort of relevant assessment - special tests or range of motion to help narrow down the source of your pain (if applicable).  Once this first part is over, I'll leave the room to give you some time to get on the table, undressing to your comfort level.<br />
                      If you book an hour treatment for your first visit, there will most likely be a solid 45-50 minutes of treatment time, followed by 5 minutes of homecare (exercises, stretches etc to help keep you pain free).
                      </dd>

                    <br />

                    <dt>What should I wear to the appointment?</dt>
                      <dd>Anything that you're comfortable in - ideally something in which you can move freely.  If you're coming in on your lunch break or straight from work however, you don't have to worry about changing. We can always work around your outfit if necessary.</dd>

                    <br />

                    <dt>Do I have to get undressed?</dt>
                      <dd>You do not have to get undressed if you don't want to - the treatment is always to YOUR comfort level.  Most people will choose to leave their underwear on while others will get completely undressed.  It is important to realize that you will be securely draped at all times and only the body part that is currently being worked on will be uncovered.</dd>

                    <br />

                    <dt>What if I have to cancel my appointment?</dt>
                      <dd>24 hours notice is required for all cancellations.  If less than this, you may be charged with a $30 fee.</dd>

                    <br />

                    <dt>Do you do deep tissue work?</dt>
                      <dd>Yes, but I can also do very light work if that is what you're looking for.  The pressure used in the treatment  will always be based on your feedback - if you want deeper or lighter pressure at any time, just let me know!</dd>

                    <br />

                    <dt>Why is it important for you to know about what medications I'm on?</dt>
                      <dd>Different meds can affect your body in different ways  -for instance if your pressure sensitivity is affected , you won't be able to accurately judge the depth of my pressure and so we would be risking potential injury to the tissue if too much pressure is used.  Some techniques (frictions) require activating the body's inflammatory response but if anti-inflammatory meds have been taken, these types of techniques would be pointless to use.</dd>

                    <br />

                    <dt>Is your treatment room wheelchair accessible?</dt>
                      <dd>Yes</dd>

                    <br />

                    <dt>What about parking?</dt>
                      <dd>There is lots of free parking around the clinic.</dd>

                    <br />

                    <dt>How can I pay for my treatment?</dt>
                      <dd>We accept cash, cheque, debit, VISA and Mastercard.</dd>
