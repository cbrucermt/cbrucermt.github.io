										<dt>Trigger Point</dt>
										<dd>A trigger point or “knot” occurs when muscles are either over or understressed, resulting in some of these muscle fibers becoming stuck in a state of constant contraction.  This restricts circulation to and from the fibers (less surface area), which in turn, creates pain and tenderness, which in turn reinforces the original contraction of fibers, etc, etc.  One way to break this pain-tension cycle is to apply pressure to these points until they gradually release.  Trigger points often have typical patterns of pain referral as well.</dd>

									<br />

									<dt>Myofascial Release<dt>
										<dd>Fascia is the layer of connective tissue that surrounds and envelops all of our muscles and tissues.  Sometimes adhesions can form between the different fascial layers, resulting in altered postures or muscle lengths.  This type of treatment is typically carried out with little or no oil and involves active or passive movement of the patient with applied pressure from the therapist in order to target the adhesions.  It is common for the patient to feel a ripping or burning sensation during this type of treatment as the adhesions are released.</dd>

									<br />

									<dt>Active Isolated Stretching (AIS)</dt>
										<dd>A type of stretching that utilizes your nervous system to maximally relax your muscles before stretching.  Typically done as a quick series of ten 2 second stretches, AIS involves active movement from the patient and a short, light overpressure from the therapist at the end of the range and can be a very effective way to increase your range of motion.</dd>

									<br />

									<dt>Muscle Energy and Neuromuscular Therapy (NMT)</dt>
										<dd>NMT are techniques in which the patient uses sub-maximal muscle contractions in a specific direction and against a specific force in order to help release those muscles and increase their range of motion or re-align the spine and pelvis.</dd>

									<br />

									<dt>Swedish and Deep Tissue Massage</dt>
										<dd>A relaxing style of massage used to increase circulation, decrease muscle tension, and can have either a stimulating or soothing effect on the nervous system depending on the technique.  Swedish massage can vary in pressure from light to deep depending on the goal of treatment and the depth of the targeted tissue.</dd>
